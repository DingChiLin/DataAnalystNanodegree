Since I think the whole point of this experiment is trying to tell user how much effort they need to put into this course and think it will reduce the number of users who drop out in the middle because they have no time, that is, the retention rate! However, in this experiment, using retention as one of the evaluation metric and take 0.01 as the minimum detectable effect value will result in huge amount of pageview requirement and makes the duration of the whole experiment unacceptable. If I using 0.03 as the minimum detectable effect value, we can track the change of retention and get conclusion withing 13 days. Even adding the 14 free trial days (since we can only track those new users who didn't even join the free trial course before), we only need 27 days to finish this experiment and see the result, I think that is acceptable and more resonable.\n",
